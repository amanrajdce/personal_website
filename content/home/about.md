# Biography

I am pursuing my graduate studies in Machine Learning and Data Science at [University of California San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu).

Previously, I was at [Facebook Research](https://research.fb.com/people/raj-aman/) as Software Engineer in Artificial Intelligence, from 2016-2018 where I worked on computer vision and machine learning problems.

I graduated with a B.Tech degree from Department of Electronics and Communication Engineering, [Delhi Technological University](http://www.dtu.ac.in), India in 2016.

I did summer internship in [AirLab](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/publications/multi-scale-convolutional-architecture-for-semantic-segmentation) at Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh in 2015.
