Developed a system prototype using BeagleBone Black and RGB camera for purpose of authorizing access and remote monitoring
in Robotics Lab(DTU). The system uses a combination of real-time face recognition and input password to authorize
access and monitors studentâ€™s activities in lab, and periodically sends these informations to lab-incharge on WhatsApp.
